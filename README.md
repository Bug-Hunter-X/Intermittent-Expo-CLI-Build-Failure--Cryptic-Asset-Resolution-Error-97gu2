# Intermittent Expo CLI Build Failure: Cryptic Asset Resolution Error

This repository demonstrates a bug where the Expo CLI build process fails intermittently with an unclear error message. The error seems to be related to asset resolution or the bundling process. The error is not consistently reproducible, which makes debugging difficult.  This repo provides examples of the problematic code and a potential solution.

## Bug Description

The Expo CLI build process sporadically fails during the build process, producing an error message that is often vague and lacks detailed information to pinpoint the root cause.  This makes it hard to track down the issue and resolve it consistently.  The error might be triggered by different actions or file changes, seemingly at random. 

## How to Reproduce

Reproducing this bug is inconsistent due to its non-deterministic nature.  It might require multiple attempts with a clean build and possibly various changes in the codebase. 

## Solution

The proposed solution focuses on techniques like cleaning the cache, verifying the integrity of the project, and ensuring that there are no conflicting dependencies.  More details on how these steps were taken are in the bugSolution.js file.

## Note

This issue may relate to underlying problems in Expo CLI, or possibly interactions with other components of the development environment. More investigation is needed to pinpoint the precise circumstances that trigger this behavior.
